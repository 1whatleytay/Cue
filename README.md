Submitted to AP Hacks 2019 (not an MLH hackathon & doesn't have a website, you have to take my word :D).
Teammates were [LunarCoffee](https://github.com/LunarCoffee), [AadityaChaudhary](https://github.com/AadityaChaudhary) and [Tifgy](https://github.com/tifgy).

The project ended up winning!
For me this was kinda a reinforcement of the skills I learned during TU20 Cup 2019.
I'm not a big fan of the final product though, we didn't have a lot of time in the end (only 5 hours).
